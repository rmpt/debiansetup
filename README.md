# debiansetup
A simple bash script to speed up and automate Debian components setup

Allows you to automatically install and configure:
- Transmission
- Samba
- Java
- Tomcat
- Mount
- Network
- PostresSQL
- OwnCloud (in progress)

To enable/disable element setup, just edit the header of *setup.sh* file and put 1/0, respectively.

I use it a lot with my Raspberry Pi. There's some hardcoded configs for me, but maybe I will create some configs for that. Anyway, it's a simple script, you can just edit whatever you want :)
